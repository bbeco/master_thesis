Full spherical images are gaining interest in fields like robotics and 
Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR)
\todo{aggiungere Autonoumus Driving}; 
consumer devices like Head-Mounted 
Display demand for cheaper alternatives for 3D content creation and this caused
full spherical cameras to spread further.

The researches that revolves around spherical images are way less popular than 
the ones that consider traditional perspective cameras, but this new kind of 
devices allow for an improvement in the quantity of information  that can 
be captured in a single shot.

In this work we developed a Structure From Motion pipeline for 
full spherical cameras composed of two main
parts: camera poses estimation and dense point cloud reconstruction.

We tested the performance of our work both with a synthetic 3D scene and with 
a real sequence captured with the Ricoh Theta S.
