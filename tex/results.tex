\lhead{\chaptername~\thechapter. \emph{Spherical SfM}}
In this chapter we comment the results obtained with our SfM pipeline.
We tested our approach with both some computer-generated and real environments.
We compare the pose estimation results with ground truth in the synthetic cases
while we only give a qualitative evaluation for the multi-view stereo
reconstruction step for both the syntetic and real video sequences.
We obtained all the results with MATLAB R2017a on a \todo{aggiungere caratteristiche macchina laboratorio}
